# Nginx-config-files-Loz  
Config files for: Proxmox, Wiki.js, Hedgedoc, PfSense, OpenVPN Access Server, Visual Studio Code Server  
### Warning!    
**I host these services for my own needs, my services are not accessible to the public.**  
**I use CloudFlare WAF, CloudFlare Zero Trust, CloudFlare reverse proxy, router firewalls, and host firewalls to keep my systems safe.**  
**My point is I have not done much research into securing Nginx for use on publicly accessible infrastructure.**  
**These configs work for me, they might work for you.**
#### I am open to suggestions an how to improve them!  
Thank you.
